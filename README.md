Unsupervised learning to extract text from images and determine keywords within the text


## Topic
In this project I will experiment with Optical Character Recognition or OCR to convert written information contained within an image to text string containing the same information in the 
image. I will do this with the help of EasyOCR which is a prebuilt and pretrained network consisting of convolution and recurrent layers. I will then try to extract the keywords present in
the extracted text and plot those keywords using WordCloud which plots the words' size proportional to the importance of the word in the text. So let's get started !


## Objectives
 -Perform OCR to extract text from images
- Select and plot the most important keywords contained within the text
